# Changelog

Hand-written, one section per release. The release workflow extracts the
section matching the tag it was triggered by and uses it as the GitHub Release
body, so a tag with no matching section here fails the release rather than
publishing an empty one.

Versions follow the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` heading form (`## 0.1.0`); tags carry a
`v` prefix (`v0.1.0`).

## 0.1.0

First public release. macOS only, unsigned (see
[docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for the Gatekeeper steps).

### Agents

- Data-driven agent adapters: Claude, pi, and opencode ship bundled, and any
  agent CLI can be added by dropping a `schema_version = 1` TOML into
  `~/.config/sway/agents/`. See `ADAPTERS.md`.
- An **Agents** section in Settings showing, per adapter, whether its CLI is
  installed, which version, where sessions are read from, and what Sway can do
  with it. Binaries resolve against the login-shell PATH, so an agent installed
  via nvm, volta, asdf, or mise is found rather than reported missing.
- First run opens on those cards with a short welcome, once.

### Sessions

- Session tree grouped into spaces, with a git-branch graph, worktree support,
  and focus-or-resume terminal tabs.
- Live status per session: working / needs-you / done, with a bubbling rollup
  to the parent rows. Claude additionally drives status from its own hooks.
- Turn-level checkpoints: snapshot per prompt, per-turn diffs, and revert.
- Transcript viewer, touched-file lists, and a context-window meter for
  adapters that declare one.

### Editor and review

- CodeMirror editor with LSP (TypeScript/JavaScript), diff gutters, and
  markdown/image preview.
- Changes panel with stage, unstage, commit, push, and Open PR.
- Hunk comments and editor-selection mentions sent safely into a session.
- Project-wide search.

### Interface

- Command palette (`Cmd+K`), quick open (`Cmd+P`), a shortcut sheet (`Cmd+/`),
  and remappable hotkeys.
- Menu-bar tray, OS notifications, and a dock badge for sessions needing you.
- Dark and light themes, both fully supported, with VS Code theme file import.

### Known limitations

- macOS only; unsigned, so first launch needs the steps in
  [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).
- Update checking is a notice only; Sway never installs an update for you.
